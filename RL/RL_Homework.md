## Homework Reinforcement Learning (Gorka Mu√±oz)

**First assignment:**
- Train a policy which learns which arm of a multiarmed bandit needs to be pulled to get the highest reward. You can find the class describing the mult-armed bandit in *MBA.py*.
The policy should be based on the incremental implementation and the *e*-greedy method. For *e* = [0,0.01,0.1], plot the reward obtained at each episode (go up to 1000 episodes), averaged over 2000 runs of the algorithm. Each run consists in the training of a zero-initialized policy.

**Second assignment:**
- Train a policy to find which frequency can drive a three level system from the initial state to a target state. More details to come...

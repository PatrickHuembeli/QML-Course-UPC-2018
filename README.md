Coding exercises for UPC QML course


# Google Colab File
For those who cannot make pytorch run on their computer, they can create a google Colab file. For this they need a google / gmail account and access their google drive.
The following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_pmKbc_sN32TMHSXotBug-QqJAHkT9-s) provides a Colab file that helps you set up everything. You can access your data on your google drive and install python packages like pytorch.

This file will help you set up the first neural network that classifies Ising configurations according to their phases, like in this [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01735.pdf).

# Homework
- First you need to set up your programming environment. If you have a Linux or Mac computer then we recommend installing [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) and install all the packages with it. Google will help you out.
In the end you will need especially [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

- If you have a windows computer we recommend using the Google Colab file from above. You can also use it if you don't want to set up your own programming environment on Linux and Mac.

## Homework General

The Homework have to be finished until the end of the course, before the exam. In groups of 3 people (There will be one group of 4) they can be solved and handed in as a short report that contains

- The code that is well commented, such that one can understand what you have done.
- A flux diagram or pseudocode that describes the code
- A description in your own words, what you were doing and explaining the code.
- Results such as igures or diagrams.
